### Overview of Random Forest Modeling

Random Forest (RF) is an ensemble machine learning method that builds a collection of decision trees (a "forest") and combines their results to improve accuracy and robustness. Each tree has a slightly different "perspective" because it uses a random subset of the data.  Decision splits within a tree are also based on a random selection of features.  RF can be used for both **classification** (categorical outcome) and **regression** (numeric outcome) tasks.

‚ùó Important: 
- Files must contain only the variables needed for modeling (features + outcome) and should have no missing data.
- If the outcome variable is binary, it must be coded 1/0 with 1 = positive class (e.g., control cases) and 0 = negative class (e.g., patient cases).
- Multiclass modeling is not currently supported

üí° Tip: Basic descriptive statistics are shown for the selected variable in the Data tab.

### Random Forest Analysis

- Sets a random seed for reproducibility `set.seed(42)`
- Calculates variable importance using **Mean Decrease in Impurity**.
  - Variables with higher scores contribute more to prediction accuracy.
  - The 1 SD cutoff score for variable importance is calculated.
- Randomizes rows (cases) prior to conducting RF modeling (`sample()`).
- Designates binary categorical outcome variables `as.factor`.
- Offers the option to **standardize** numeric variables to to mean = 0 and SD = 1 (`scale()`). 
  - This prevents bias when variable scales differ substantially. 
  - The outcome variable is not standardized.

### Key Parameters

- **mtry** (`mtry`): Number of variables randomly selected at each decision split.
- **number of trees** (`ntree`): Number of decision trees in the forest.
- **Tree depth** (`maxnodes`): Maximum depth of individual trees (how many questions a tree can ask)
- **Auto**: `mtry` = sqrt(no. features) for all datasets
  - For N<1000: `ntrees` = 100 and `maxnodes` = maximum 
  - For N>1000: `ntrees` = 500 and `maxnodes` = 10
- üí° Tip: Max tree depth is designated as `maxnodes <- "Null"` in the code meaning no depth limit is set.

### Cross-Validation (CV) Options

- **None**: uses entire dataset for training without validation.
- **K-folds**: splits data into k folds; each fold is used for testing once.
- **LOOCV**: Leave-One-Out CV (1 sample per test fold).

---

### Class Balancing Methods

- **None**: uses original class distribution.
- **Upsample**: randomly replicates minority class (with replacement) up to double the minority class size.
- **Downsample**: randomly reduces majority class to match minority class.
- üí° Tip: Class balancing does not work reliably with LOOCV - use k-folds CV instead.

### Interpretation of Results

#### For Classification:

- **Confusion Matrix**: Summarizes correct vs. incorrect classifications. Correct predictions are shown on the diagonal and incorrect predictions on the off-diagonal.
- **AUC (Area Under Curve)**: Measures overall classifier performance (0.5 = chance, 1.0 = perfect).
- **F1 Score**: Also known as F-measure.  Combines precision and recall.
- **Sensitivity (Recall)**: True positive rate.
- **Specificity**: True negative rate.
- **ROC Plot**: Visualization of the balance between sensitivity and specificity

#### For Regression:

- **R squared**: Proportion of variance explained.
- **Adj. R squared**: Proportion of variance explained adjusted for the number of features.
- **Actual vs Predicted Plot**: Visualization of model fit.

üí° Tips 
  - F1 Score may not be computed in certain  situations such as:
    - LOOCV
    - Using a high k value in k-folds CV with small samples.
    - Datasets with severe class imbalance
    - Models where sensitivity (recall) = is zero or near zero. 
  - You must Run Random Forest again after changing any options or parameters.
  - You can save a plot by right-clicking and choosing ‚ÄúSave Image As‚Ä¶‚Äù
  - Selecting ‚ÄúSave trained model‚Äù will save the RF model (`save(rf_model.RData, file = "/path_to_file"`)
---

### Prediction

- In this tab, you can load a previously saved RF model and apply it to new data to predict the outcome for new cases: `predict(rf_model, new_data)`.
- The variable names in the new data must match exactly those in the model data.
- The data types must be compatible (e.g., numeric vs. categorical).
- Do **not** include the outcome variable in the new data.
- Do **not** preprocess the new data - the `predict()` function will automatically apply any preprocessing used for the model to the new data.

### Code Tab

Basic code and logic will be displayed here reflecting your input selections.  You can copy and paste this code into an R script and run it after minor edits to learn more about how code-based data analysis works.

### Example Methods Description

<span style="font-size: 95%;"> We conducted a random forest classification analysis using the R Statistical Package (v.x.x) using standard parameters (mtry = 4, number of trees = 500, tree depth = 10) and a 10-folds cross-validation strategy.  Because of class imbalance, we first conducted random minority class upsampling. Features were standardized (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1) and cases were randomized prior to modeling. Model performance metrics represented the mean values across cross-validation folds.  We measured feature importance using the mean impurity decrease (MID), which indicates how well a feature separates data at a decision split in the decision tree.  We defined the most important features as having an MID greater than 1 standard deviation above the mean MID across features.</span>
