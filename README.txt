https://cran.r-project.org

Be sure to follow installation instructions for your operating system.

-----------------------------------------
ðŸ“¦ Step 2: Launch R and install dependencies
-----------------------------------------
1. Open the R application (not RStudio).
2. In the R console, paste and run the following command:

install.packages(c(
  "shiny", "cluster", "factoextra", "dplyr", "shinyFiles", "ggplot2", "fs",
  "DT", "markdown", "naniar", "missRanger", "readr", "gridExtra", "rlang",
